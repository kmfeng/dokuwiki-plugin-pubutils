  In this paper we present the implementation of a framework for accelerating training and
  classification of arbitrary Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the GPU. CNNs are a
  derivative of standard Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks optimized for two-dimensional
  pattern recognition problems such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or face detection.
  We describe the basic parts of a CNN and demonstrate the performance and scalability improvement
  that can be achieved by shifting the computation-intensive tasks of a CNN to the GPU. Depending
  on the network topology training and classification on the GPU performs 2 to 24 times faster
  than on the CPU. Furthermore, the GPU version scales much better than the CPU implementation
  with respect to the network size.
